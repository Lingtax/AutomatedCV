# AutomatedCV

This project is designed to build an automated CV with citation counts and impact factors for all publications.

Citation counts are taken from *Google Scholar* and Impact Factors are taken from a *JournalRank.csv*. In this version publication lists are taken from scraping data from Google Scholar. 

I'm working on generating publication lists from ORCID due to better data quality.

You can make a simple graph of your citations and get a spreadsheet of your papers with their citation counts by running "simple.R"
